ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @quintablet, I'm a retired pharmacist trying to keep up with new technology and programming.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Photography, Ham Radio and DIY projects for the home.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (re-)learning how to program in C and C++, in addition to learning python.

I learn by studying the more experienced programmer's code who use GitHub.  Thank you!
